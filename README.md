# Bumper: Code defined motion graphics
What if you had the limitlessness of code defined graphics, and the instant feedback that a GUI gives?

Bumper is an experimental motion graphic design program based (for now) on the OLC PixelGameEngine.

Users can write and dynamically reload graphical modules that they can then use to create art with in the compositor and instantly change layout, custom defined parameters and effects.

roadmap:
- basic modules
- compositor
- custom parameters
- Effects
- Bindings
- ...

# dependencies for building
